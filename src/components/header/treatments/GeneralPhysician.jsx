              General physician care focuses on holistic healthcare, covering
              the prevention, diagnosis, and management of a wide range of
              medical conditions. Patients often consult general physicians for
              routine health check-ups, vaccinations, and essential screenings
              such as blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol levels.
            </p>

            <p>
              General physicians are the first point of contact for common
              illnesses, including respiratory infections, digestive issues,
              allergies, and urinary tract infections. They also provide
              long-term care for chronic conditions like hypertension, diabetes,
              thyroid disorders, and asthma—monitoring health status, adjusting
              medications, and offering lifestyle and dietary guidance.
            </p>

            <p>
              In addition, general physicians coordinate patient care by
              referring individuals to specialists when advanced care is needed,
              ensuring continuity through follow-ups and collaborative treatment
              planning.
            </p>

            <p>
              By focusing on personalized care, preventive strategies, and early
              intervention, general physicians play a crucial role in
              maintaining overall health and promoting long-term well-being.
